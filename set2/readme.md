TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

1. % operator implies zero division (which could be used to find if the number was odd or even; if number's modulo two is zero, then it's even)
2. = used to add value, while == means equality
3. != means that values are not equal
4. ctrl+shift+l select all things equal to one selected (all repeats)
5. ! should i push readme to GitHub???
6. "calling" a function == run the code with this function in it, execute, run it
7. def means describe a function
8. return is different from print
9. different types of data: values, variables, expressions, functions, collections, flow control, iteration
10. if, elif, else are conditions operators (flow control)
11. for i in range() means for each i in range() .
